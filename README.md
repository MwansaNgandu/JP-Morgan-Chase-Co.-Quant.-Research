# JP Morgan Chase Co. Quantiatative Research

Welcome to my repository for the **JPMorgan Chase & Co. Quantitative Research** program, completed through Forage. This repository showcases my personal approach to each project task and reflects the skills developed in quantitative finance and data analysis. Note that the code here represents my interpretations and methods for each challenge, rather than the official solutions to the program tasks.

## Project Overview

This program offered an immersive experience in tasks that quantitative researchers handle at JPMorgan Chase & Co. Each project simulated key challenges faced in financial modeling, data analysis, and risk assessment. The repository includes code and comments for the following tasks:

### 1. **Price Data Analysis**
   - Analyzed seasonal trends in natural gas prices by projecting historical price data to enhance forecast accuracy over 18 months. This task aimed to support commodity trading decisions with a clear view of price trends.
   
### 2. **Commodity Storage Contract Pricing**
   - Developed a model to price natural gas storage contracts, incorporating costs such as storage fees, transportation, and buy/sell price differentials. The model provides a flexible structure for pricing under varied contract terms.
   
### 3. **Credit Risk Analysis**
   - Built a credit risk model to categorize loan portfolios by risk level, based on FICO score segmentation. This model supports risk-adjusted lending by predicting default probabilities and categorizing credit risk.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming**: Python
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, dynamic programming
- **Libraries**: NumPy, pandas, and custom-built functions for financial modeling and risk analysis

The code here is developed solely as my interpretation of the tasks and is intended for educational purposes only. It is not a replica of the official solutions provided by JPMorgan Chase & Co.
